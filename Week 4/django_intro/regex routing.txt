regex routing
Note: ALL route patterns at the app level should end with $

^ - indicates a matching string starts with whatever follows this character
Example: '^a' matches 'anna' but not 'banana'
$ - indicates a matching string ends with whatever precedes this character
Example: 'a$' matches 'anna' and 'banana' but not 'fan'
Example: '^a$' matches only the letter 'a'
